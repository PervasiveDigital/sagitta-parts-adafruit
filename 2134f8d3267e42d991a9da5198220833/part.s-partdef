This breakout comes with 3 analog outputs for X, Y and Z axis measurements on a 0.75&quot;x0.75&quot; breakout board. The ADXL326 is the latest and greatest from Analog Devices, known for their exceptional quality MEMS devices. The VCC takes up to 5V in and regulates it to 3.3V with an output pin. The analog outputs are ratiometric: that means that 0g measurement output is always at half of the 3.3V output (1.65V), -16g is at 0v and 16g is at 3.3V with full scaling in between.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85419700","family":"Adafruit ADXL326","variant":"1","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #1018","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Mon Jul 4 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_64428f4fc9f0ac58ff542487ec66102c_7"},"Tags":[]}
