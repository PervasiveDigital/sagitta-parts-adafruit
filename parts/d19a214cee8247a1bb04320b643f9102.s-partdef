Inside the chip are three sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, which can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity) or how fast the board is accelerating in 3D space. The other is a 3-axis magnetometer that can sense where the strongest magnetic force is coming from, generally used to detect magnetic north. The third is a 3-axis gyroscope that can measure spin and twist. By combining this data you can REALLY orient yourself.</p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">An update from the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/2021\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">LSM9DS0</span></a>, the new <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">LSM9DS1</span> from ST micro makes for a great breakout at a very nice price! Design your own activity or motion tracker with all the data... We spun up a breakout board that has all the extra circuitry you'll want, like a 3V regulator and level shifting circuitry so it can be used by 3V or 5V power/logic microcontrollers like the Arduino.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85434091","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit LSM9DS1 9DoF Breakout","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #3387","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Wed Feb 1 2017","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_368bb09c296295bcb2787ba7879512f2_13"},"Tags":[]}
