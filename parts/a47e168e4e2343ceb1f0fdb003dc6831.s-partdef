The processor has plenty of GPIO, Analog inputs, hardware UART SPI and I2C, timers and PWM galore - just enough for most simple projects. When we need to go small, we use a <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/2010\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">Pro Trinket 3V</span></a> or <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2000\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">5V</span></a>, but when size isn't as much of a concern, and an USB-serial converter is required, we reach for an Adafruit METRO. </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">This is the <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">Adafruit METRO with headers.  </span>It comes with headers soldered on.  It's a fully assembled and tested board with SMT headers attached as well as through hole headers.  If you don't want a Metro with through-hole headers or at least, holes for them, but not attached for super-slimness, check out our <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2466\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">Metro without Headers.</span></a> </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">METRO is the culmination of years of playing with AVRs: we wanted to make a development board that is easy to use and is hacker friendly. At the heart is an ATmega328P, with 32KB of flash and 2KB of RAM, running at 16 MHz</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85420301","family":"Adafruit Metro","variant":"SMT Headers","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #2488","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Mon Jul 4 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_bf7716a8852e6139b2fed650c15144aa_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_0fe384ca1c5c86f14657f784791c7343_1_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_0fe384ca1c5c86f14657f784791c7343_1_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_0fe384ca1c5c86f14657f784791c7343_1_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
