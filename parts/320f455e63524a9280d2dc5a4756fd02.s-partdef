Or lets say you want to test your microcontroller's conversion accuracy &amp; precision. If only you had a dependable, high precision, rock-solid voltage reference. Now you know why we made this very cute and useful little breakout board. It has two very high precision shunt-type voltage references with 750 ohm biasing resistors. One is 2.048V (great for 3.3V reference systems) and the other is 4.096 (great for 5V). Both are 0.1% accuracy!</p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">Using is easy, just power with about 5V-12V, or 3V if you want only the 2V reference to work. Then measure the voltage on the output. Note that these are not <span style=\" font-style:italic;\">regulators</span><span style=\" font-weight:600; font-style:italic;\"> </span>- you can't power anything off the output. They are for measurements only.
