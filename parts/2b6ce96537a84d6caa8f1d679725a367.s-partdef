We took the same technology from our Flora NeoPixels and made them breadboard friendly, with two rows of 3 x 0.1&quot; spaced header on each side for easy soldering, chaining and breadboarding. These ultra-bright LEDs have a constant-current driver cooked right into the LED package! The pixels are chainable - so you only need 1 pin/wire to control as many LEDs as you like.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85425218","part number":"Adafruit #1312","layer":null,"variant":"variant 1","family":"NeoPixel","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Aug 2 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_2a2834137ed34dbde9dd3a3dabf07fbf_9"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_2a2834137ed34dbde9dd3a3dabf07fbf_9_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.5,"NativeHeightInInches":0.4,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_2a2834137ed34dbde9dd3a3dabf07fbf_9_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.2,"NativeHeightInInches":0.9,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_2a2834137ed34dbde9dd3a3dabf07fbf_9_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.5,"NativeHeightInInches":0.4,"Layers":{}}}}
