Resistive touch screens are incredibly popular as overlays to TFT and LCD displays. Only problem is they require a bunch of analog pins and you have to keep polling them since the overlays themselves are basically just big potentiometers. If your microcontroller doesn't have analog inputs, or maybe you want just a way more elegant controller, the STMPE610 is a nice way to solve that problem.</span></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'.Helvetica Neue DeskInterface'; font-size:13pt;\">This breakout board features the STMPE610, which has both I2C and SPI interfaces available. There is also an interrupt pin that you can use to indicate when a touch has been detected to your microcontroller or microcomputer. We wrapped up the chip with a 3V voltage regulator and level shifting so it's safe to use with 3V or 5V logic. Its a nicely designed chip, and has very stable precise readings. We found its also a lot faster than trying to do all the readings on an Arduino.</span></p></body></html>","Author":"andydoro","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85428178","family":"Adafruit STMPE610 Breakout","part number":"Adafruit #1571","layer":null,"variant":"variant 1","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Aug 16 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_4ae66132998862d212acc046389c2f5b_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_4ae66132998862d212acc046389c2f5b_1_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.1,"NativeHeightInInches":0.825,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_4ae66132998862d212acc046389c2f5b_1_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.2,"NativeHeightInInches":1.3,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_4ae66132998862d212acc046389c2f5b_1_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.1,"NativeHeightInInches":0.825,"Layers":{}}}}
