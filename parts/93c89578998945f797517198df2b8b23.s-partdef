This display is made of 128x64 individual white OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip. Because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. This reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast; we really like this miniature display for its crispness!</span></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica';\">This breakout can be used with either an SPI or I2C interface - selectable by soldering two jumpers on the back. The design is completely 5V-ready, with an onboard regulator and built in boost converter. It's easier than ever to connect directly to your 3V or 5V microcontroller without needing any kind of level shifter!</span></p></body></html>","Author":"Adafruit","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85429799","variant":"Mono 128x64 0.96 inch","part number":"326","family":"Adafruit OLED","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Wed Aug 24 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_7bed4411165d8a23a3d211d4abc65c2e_1"},"Tags":[]}
