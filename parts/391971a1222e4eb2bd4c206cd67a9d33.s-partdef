Or maybe you don't even know how to use microcontrollers, you just want to make a sound play whenever you press a button. What about something that has to be very small and portable? You are probably feeling a little frustrated: it's been very hard to find a simple, low cost audio effects trigger that is easy to use and does not require any programming </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-weight:600;\">UNTIL NOW!</span> </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">Don't get me wrong, I love the MP3 Music Maker shield and the Audio <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2217\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">FX Sound Board + 2x2W Amp</span></a>.  And our Wave Shield is a dependable classic.  But you either need an Arduino or they might be a little too big and powerful for your needs.  So after a lot of engineering and tinkering we've come out with the Adafruit <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">MINI</span> Sound Board, the fastest way to add audio effects to a project, with a small footprint. We think this is the best sound board for props and costumes!</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85421365","family":"Adafruit Audio FX Mini Sound Board","variant":"variant 1","part number":"Adafruit #2342 and #2220","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Jul 8 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_4b102cee63685c3993818c224dc1e9b0_13"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_4b102cee63685c3993818c224dc1e9b0_14_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_4b102cee63685c3993818c224dc1e9b0_14_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_4b102cee63685c3993818c224dc1e9b0_14_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
