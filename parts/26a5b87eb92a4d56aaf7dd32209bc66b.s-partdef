You are a 1-Wire kinda gal, and you want more 1-Wire breakouts in your life to complement all of your great engineering. Well rock on, because here you go, it's a 1-Wire controller with two open-drain GPIO.</span></p>\n<p style=\"-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-family:'.Helvetica Neue DeskInterface'; font-size:13pt;\"><br /></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'.Helvetica Neue DeskInterface'; font-size:13pt;\">You can put as many of the DS2413's as you want on a single I/O line, each one is uniquely addressable and shares the single I/O pin happily. The two controllable I/O lines (PIOA and PIOB) can be used as inputs or outputs. They are open-drain, so if you want to power an LED or something, you'll need a remote power supply (see Maxim's product page for more details)</span></p></body></html>","Author":"andydoro","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85429680","family":"Adafruit DS2413","variant":"variant 2","part number":"Adafruit #1551","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Aug 23 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_46c6640fdefb98953a89b9f0d3e038b3_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_46c6640fdefb98953a89b9f0d3e038b3_3_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_46c6640fdefb98953a89b9f0d3e038b3_3_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_46c6640fdefb98953a89b9f0d3e038b3_3_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
