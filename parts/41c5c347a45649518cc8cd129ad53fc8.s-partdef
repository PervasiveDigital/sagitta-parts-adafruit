At its heart is a TPS61030 boost converter from TI. This boost converter chip has some really nice extras such as low battery detection, 4A internal switch, synchronous conversion, excellent efficiency, and 700KHz high-frequency operation.","Author":"Dean Cording","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85411093","family":"PowerBoost","output connector":"USB","input connector":"Screw terminal","variant":"1000","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"1","fritzingDate":"2014-08-17","fritzingModuleId":"PowerBoost 1000 Basic Terminal USB"},"Tags":["adafruit","tps61090","boost converter","breakout"],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\PowerBoost 1000 Basic Terminal USB_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.46618,"NativeHeightInInches":0.903413,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\PowerBoost 1000 Basic Terminal USB_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.4,"NativeHeightInInches":1.0,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\PowerBoost 1000 Basic Terminal USB_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.46618,"NativeHeightInInches":0.903413,"Layers":{}}}}
