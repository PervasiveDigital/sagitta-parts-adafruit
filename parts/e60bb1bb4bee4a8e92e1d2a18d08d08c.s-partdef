This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring barometric pressure and temperature. Because pressure changes with altitude you can also use it as an altimeter!<br /><br />The BMP183 is the next-generation of sensors from Bosch, and is the fraternal twin of the BMP180 - with a low altitude noise of 0.25m and the same fast conversion time. It has the same specifications, but uses SPI instead of I2C. This is great for users where there is an I2C address collision, they want more than one sensor on a single microcontroller, more flexibility on pin usage, or just prefer the simplicity of SPI.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85418798","family":"Adafruit BMP183 Breakout","variant":"1","part number":null,"layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sat Jul 2 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_b7671a03bf0a2ae37b99f5fac080a2b3_1"},"Tags":["sensor","bmp183","adafruit","spi","pressure","temperature","barometric"]}
