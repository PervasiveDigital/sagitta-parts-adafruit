And, hey, it does exactly what it says on the tin! This Real Time Clock (RTC) is the most precise you can get in a small, low power package.</span></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'.SF NS Text'; font-size:13pt;\">Most RTCs use an external 32kHz timing crystal that is used to keep time with low current draw. And that's all well and good, but those crystals have slight drift, particularly when the temperature changes (the temperature changes the oscillation frequency very very very slightly but it does add up!) This RTC is in a beefy package because the crystal is inside the chip! And right next to the integrated crystal is a temperature sensor. That sensor compensates for the frequency changes by adding or removing clock ticks so that the timekeeping stays on schedule. </span></p></body></html>","Author":"Adafruit","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85421371","variant":"variant 2","family":"Adafruit DS3231","part number":"Adafruit #3013","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Jul 12 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_2733c17b59ee58d6fb19255d43d47d62_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_2733c17b59ee58d6fb19255d43d47d62_1_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.9,"NativeHeightInInches":0.7,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_2733c17b59ee58d6fb19255d43d47d62_1_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.2,"NativeHeightInInches":1.0,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_2733c17b59ee58d6fb19255d43d47d62_1_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.9,"NativeHeightInInches":0.7,"Layers":{}}}}
