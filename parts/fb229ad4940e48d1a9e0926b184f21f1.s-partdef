LCDs are a fun and easy way to have your microcontroller project talk back to you. Character LCDs are common, and easy to get, available in tons of colors and sizes. <a href=\"http://learn.adafruit.com/character-lcds\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">We've written tutorials on using character LCDs with an Arduino</span></a> (or similar microcontroller) but find that the number of pins necessary to control the LCD can be restrictive, especially with ambitious projects. We wanted to make a 'backpack' (add-on circuit) that would reduce the number of pins without a lot of expense.<br /><br />By using simple i2c and SPI input/output expanders we have reduced the number of pins (only 2 pins are needed for i2c) while still making it easy to interface with the LCD. For Arduino users, we provide a easy-to-use library that is backwards compatible with projects using the '6 pin' wiring. The breakout comes with a 2-pin and 3-pin terminal block as shown (you can snap it together to make a 5-pin terminal and then solder it to the backpack for easy wiring)</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85429359","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit I2C+SPI LCD Backpack","part number":"Adafruit #292","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Mon Aug 22 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_046495de451e540e0a73a3ca34ad6bf0_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_046495de451e540e0a73a3ca34ad6bf0_2_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.97421,"NativeHeightInInches":0.877008,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_046495de451e540e0a73a3ca34ad6bf0_2_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.5,"NativeHeightInInches":1.9,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_046495de451e540e0a73a3ca34ad6bf0_2_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.97421,"NativeHeightInInches":0.877008,"Layers":{}}}}
