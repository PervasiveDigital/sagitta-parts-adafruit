Because pressure changes with altitude you can also use it as an altimeter! The sensor is soldered onto a PCB with a 3.3V regulator, I2C level shifter and pull-up resistors on the I2C pins.<br /><br />The BMP180 is the next-generation of sensors from Bosch, and replaces the BMP085. The good news is that it is <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">completely identical to the BMP085 in terms of firmware/software</span> - you can use our BMP085 tutorial and any example code/libraries as a drop-in replacement. The XCLR pin is not physically present on the BMP180 so if you need to know that data is ready you will need to query the I2C bus.<br /><br />This board is 5V compliant - a 3.3V regulator and a i2c level shifter circuit is included so you can use this sensor safely with 5V logic and power.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85418796","variant":"1","family":"Adafruit BMP180 Breakout","part number":null,"layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sat Jul 2 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_7eab5a19a8bd1858b2030f275587a7ae_1"},"Tags":["barometric","sensor","adafruit","i2c","temperature","pressure"],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_7eab5a19a8bd1858b2030f275587a7ae_2_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_7eab5a19a8bd1858b2030f275587a7ae_2_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_7eab5a19a8bd1858b2030f275587a7ae_2_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
