For that reason, we like using 4050/74LVX245 series and similar logic to perform proper level shifting. Only problem is that they are only good in one direction which can be a problem for some specialty bi-diectional interfaces and also makes wiring a little hairy.</span></p></body></html>","Author":"Adafruit","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85427080","part number":null,"variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit TXB0104","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Aug 12 2016","fritzingModuleId":"TXB0104_ac06c1d31a374a15446155061db47984_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\TXB0104_ac06c1d31a374a15446155061db47984_1_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.5,"NativeHeightInInches":0.7,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\TXB0104_ac06c1d31a374a15446155061db47984_1_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.0,"NativeHeightInInches":1.1,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\TXB0104_ac06c1d31a374a15446155061db47984_1_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.5,"NativeHeightInInches":0.7,"Layers":{}}}}
