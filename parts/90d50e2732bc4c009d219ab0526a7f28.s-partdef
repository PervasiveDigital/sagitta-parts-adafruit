Simply point the sensor towards what you want to measure and it will detect the temperature by absorbing IR waves emitted. The embedded thermopile sensor generates a very very small voltage depending on how much IR there is, and using some math, that micro voltage can be used to calculate the temperature. It also takes the measurement over an area so it can be handy for determining the average temperature of something.</span></p></body></html>","Author":"Adafruit","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85425908","layer":null,"variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit TMP006","part number":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Thu Aug 4 2016","fritzingModuleId":"TMP006_2b5908838f3a5c2780a20ca53175b8db_7"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\TMP006_017d577f640f7b040c461e0fccafde9d_1_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\TMP006_017d577f640f7b040c461e0fccafde9d_1_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\TMP006_017d577f640f7b040c461e0fccafde9d_1_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
