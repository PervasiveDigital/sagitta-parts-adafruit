Either they were too slow, or too difficult to use, or required signing an NDA, or had limited functionality, or too expensive, or too large. So we shied away from carrying any general purpose microcontroller-friendly WiFi boards.</span></p>\n<p style=\"-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-family:'.Helvetica Neue DeskInterface'; font-size:13pt;\"><br /></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'.Helvetica Neue DeskInterface'; font-size:13pt;\">NO LONGER! The CC3000 hits that sweet spot of usability, price and capability. It uses SPI for communication (not UART!) so you can push data as fast as you want or as slow as you want. It has a proper interrupt system with IRQ pin so you can have asynchronous connections. It supports 802.11b/g, open/WEP/WPA/WPA2 security, TKIP &amp; AES. A built in TCP/IP stack with a &quot;BSD socket&quot; interface. TCP and UDP in both client and server mode, up to 4 concurrent sockets. It does not support &quot;AP&quot; mode, it can connect to an access point but it cannot be an access point.</span></p></body></html>","Author":"andydoro","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85431611","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit CC3000 WiFi Breakout","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #1469 and #1510","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Aug 26 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_58492076e331b0c11c3f56457830134f_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_58492076e331b0c11c3f56457830134f_3_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.02362,"NativeHeightInInches":1.5748,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_58492076e331b0c11c3f56457830134f_3_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.0,"NativeHeightInInches":1.2,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_58492076e331b0c11c3f56457830134f_3_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.02362,"NativeHeightInInches":1.5748,"Layers":{}}}}
