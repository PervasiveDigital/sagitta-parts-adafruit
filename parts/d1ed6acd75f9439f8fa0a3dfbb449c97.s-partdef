This charger is a very unique design, perfect for outdoor projects, or DIY iPod chargers. We've spent over a year testing and tinkering with this charger to come up with a plug and play solution to charging batteries with the sun and we're really pleased with what we ended up with.<br /><br />Easy to use! <a href=\"http://www.adafruit.com/category/44\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">Pick up any of our many 3.7V/4.2V LiIon batteries</span></a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.adafruit.com/category/67\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">6V solar panel</span></a>. Plug the battery into the <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">BATT</span> port using a 2-pin JST cable and the solar panel into the DC jack using a <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/2788\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">2.1mm adapter cable</span></a> Put the solar panel outside (and keep the battery out of the sun, it needs to be kept cool!) to start charging. You can power another project like a Mintyboost at the same time by connecting to the <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">LOAD</span> output port</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85431880","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit USB DC Solar LiPo Charger","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #390","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Aug 26 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_e2038ea6b62cf4a9b6ce794eacb71a7f_1"},"Tags":[]}
