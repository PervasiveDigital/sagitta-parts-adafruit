We added an on-board 3.3V regulator and logic-level shifting circuitry, making it a perfect choice for interfacing with any 3V or 5V microcontroller such as the Arduino.<br /><br />The sensor has three axes of measurements, X Y Z, and pins that can be used either as I2C or SPI digital interfacing. You can set the sensitivity level to either +-2g, +-4g, +-8g or +-16g. The lower range gives more resolution for slow movements, the higher range is good for high speed tracking. The ADXL345 is the latest and greatest from Analog Devices, known for their exceptional quality MEMS devices. The VCC takes up to 5V in and regulates it to 3.3V with an output pin.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85419702","variant":"1","family":"Adafruit ADXL345","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #1231","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Mon Jul 4 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_d34c2446fc0901e09aa5ed34d68accf9_7"},"Tags":[]}
