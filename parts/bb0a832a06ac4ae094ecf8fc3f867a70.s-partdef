Inside the miniature chip is a class D controller, able to run from 2.0V-5.5VDC. Since the amp is a class D, its very efficient (over 90% efficient when driving an 8Î© speaker at over half a Watt) - making it perfect for portable and battery-powered projects.","Author":"Dean Cording","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85411455","family":"PAM8302","variant":"1","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"1","fritzingDate":"2014-12-08","fritzingModuleId":"PAM8302A"},"Tags":["adafruit","audio","amplifier"]}
