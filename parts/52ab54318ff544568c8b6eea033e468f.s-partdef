Look no further, GEMMA is a tiny wearable platform board with a lot of might in a 1&quot; diameter package. Powered by a Attiny85 and programmable with an Arduino IDE over USB, you'll be able to realize any wearable project!</span></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica';\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica';\">We wanted to design a microcontroller board that was small enough to fit into any project, and low cost enough to use without hesitation. Perfect for when you don't want to give up your Flora and you aren't willing to take apart the project you worked so hard to design. It's our lowest-cost sewable controller!</span></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'Helvetica';\">NEW In version 2! On March 4, 2015 we released Version 2, which is physically and code-wise identical but has changed the Mini-B connection for a Micro-B USB connector and adds a much-requested On-Off switch!</span></p></body></html>","Author":"Adafruit","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85425927","layer":null,"variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit GEMMA v1","part number":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Thu Aug 4 2016","fritzingModuleId":"GemmaV1_6a940e59455cf0da45e2237085d55ff5_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\GemmaV1_607e90af2e38de80832364fcbf281743_1_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\GemmaV1_607e90af2e38de80832364fcbf281743_1_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\GemmaV1_607e90af2e38de80832364fcbf281743_1_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
