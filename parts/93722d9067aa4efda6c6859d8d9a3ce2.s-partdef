Especially when price and usability is the main selling point. So what should you do when its time to turn around and make that project of yours run on a battery or solar? Sure you <span style=\" font-style:italic;\">could</span> try to hot-air that regulator off, or you could jerry-rig a relay. Or, use a 555? Ugh, the options aren't that great.</p>\n<p style=\"-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><br /></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">The <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">Adafruit TPL5110 Power Timer</span> is a stand-alone breakout that will turn <span style=\" font-style:italic;\">any</span> electronics into low-power electronics! It will take care of turning your project on/off using a built in timer that can vary from once-every 100ms up to once every two hours. Basically, the TPL will turn on periodically, adjustable by potentiometer or resistor, and turn on your project's power. It will then wait until a signal is received from the project to tell the TPL that it can safely turn off the power.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85434095","family":"Adafruit TPL5110 Power Timer","variant":"variant 1","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #3435","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Wed Mar 1 2017","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_af16d1407177469c22340eb6add91fc1_7"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_af16d1407177469c22340eb6add91fc1_9_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_af16d1407177469c22340eb6add91fc1_9_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_af16d1407177469c22340eb6add91fc1_9_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
