TheÂ SPW2430 is a small, low cost MEMS mic with a range of 100Hz - 10KHz, good for just about all general audio recording/detection.<br /><br />This breakout is best used for projects such as voice changers, audio recording/sampling, and audio-reactive projects that use FFT. To keep the breakout small and simple, we only added a 3V voltage regulator (the microphone requires 3.3V DC) and filter capacitors. No additional opamp is included, the output peak-to-peak voltage has a 0.67V DC bias and about 100mVpp (peak-to-peak) when talking near the microphone, which is good for attaching to something that expects 'line level' input without clipping.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85418313","family":"SPW2430 Breakout","variant":"1","layer":null,"part number":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Jul 1 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_09790affdc0f0fc2b24fa02fbe6f6668_1"},"Tags":["audio","adafruit","MEMS","microphone"]}
