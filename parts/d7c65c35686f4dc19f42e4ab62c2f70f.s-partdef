So small and simple, you can use this board as an all-in-one display driver for TTL displays, or perhaps decoding HDMI/DVI video for some other project. This breakout features the TFP401 for decoding video, and for the touch version, an AR1100 USB resistive touch screen driver. </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">The TFP401 is a beefy DVI/HDMI decoder from TI. It can take unencrypted video and pipe out the raw 24-bit color pixel data - HDCP not supported! It will decode any resolution from 25-165MHz pixel clock, basically up to 1080p. We've used this breakout with 800x480 displays, so we have not specifically tested it with higher resolutions. We added a bunch of supporting circuitry like a backlight driver and configured it for running basic TTL display panels such as the ones we have in the shop</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85422788","family":"0b5df4cc334e6f653bd41cfbb6d8bb8e","variant":"variant 1","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #2218","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Thu Jul 28 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_0b5df4cc334e6f653bd41cfbb6d8bb8e_13"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_0b5df4cc334e6f653bd41cfbb6d8bb8e_13_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_0b5df4cc334e6f653bd41cfbb6d8bb8e_13_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_0b5df4cc334e6f653bd41cfbb6d8bb8e_13_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
