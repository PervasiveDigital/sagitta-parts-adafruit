For that reason, we like using 4050/74LVX245 series and similar logic to perform proper level shifting. Only problem is that they are only good in one direction which can be a problem for some specialty bi-diectional interfaces and also makes wiring a little hairy.</span></p></body></html>","Author":"Adafruit","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85427078","part number":null,"variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit TXB0108","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Aug 12 2016","fritzingModuleId":"TXB0108_3be107ba1d4971bd982d12cdddf32e11_1"},"Tags":[]}
