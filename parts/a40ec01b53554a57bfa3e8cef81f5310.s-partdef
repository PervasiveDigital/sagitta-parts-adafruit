The thumbstick is an analog joystick - more accurate and sensitive than just 'directional' joysticks - with a 'press in to select' button. Since it's analog, you'll need two analog reading pins on your microcontroller to determine X and Y. Having an extra digital input will let you read the switch.<br /><br />The pack comes in three parts - the joystick itself, a soft-touch rubber 'hat' and a nicely designed breakout board. We designed the breakout so that you can attach the joystick to a panel easily - every other breakout we wanted to carry had the mounting holes so they were in the way of the joystick movement! A 5 pin 0.1&quot; spaced header makes it easy to connect either in a perfboard/breadboard setting or free wiring. You'll need to solder the joystick into the PCB using a soldering iron and solder, but its very simple and will only take a minute.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85424323","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit Analog 2-Axis Joystick","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #512","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sun Jul 31 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_f41c0a63ce7c7c0d5ff28e0f4562f464_1"},"Tags":[]}
