This TFT display is big (2.8&quot; diagonal) bright (4 white-LED backlight) and colorful! 240x320 pixels with individual RGB pixel control, this has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">capacitive</span> single-touch touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. (<a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/1770\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">We also have a resistive touchscreen version of this display breakout</span></a>)<br /><br />This display has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. The display can be used in two modes: 8-bit and SPI. For 8-bit mode, you'll need 8 digital data lines and 4 or 5 digital control lines to read and write to the display (12 lines total). SPI mode requires only 5 pins total (SPI data in, data out, clock, select, and d/c) but is slower than 8-bit mode. In addition, 2 I2C pins are required for the touch screen controller.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85424993","variant":"variant 1","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #2090","family":"Adafruit 2.8 inch Captouch TFT","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Aug 2 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_3b1d4cb72b41eb6b727492f3a8cba46c_13"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_3b1d4cb72b41eb6b727492f3a8cba46c_15_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_3b1d4cb72b41eb6b727492f3a8cba46c_15_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_3b1d4cb72b41eb6b727492f3a8cba46c_15_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
