At 1.5 hPa resolution, it's not as precise as our favorite pressure sensor, the BMP085, which has up to 0.03 hPa resolution so we don't suggest it as a precision altimeter. However, it's great for basic barometric pressure sensing. The sensor is soldered onto a PCB with 10K pull-up resistors on the I2C pins.</span></p></body></html>","Author":"Adafruit","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85427088","part number":null,"variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit MPL115A2","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Aug 12 2016","fritzingModuleId":"MPL115A2_1ed98f2b272a0b0349f2d4bc1662aba6_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\MPL115A2_1ed98f2b272a0b0349f2d4bc1662aba6_1_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\MPL115A2_1ed98f2b272a0b0349f2d4bc1662aba6_1_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\MPL115A2_1ed98f2b272a0b0349f2d4bc1662aba6_1_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
