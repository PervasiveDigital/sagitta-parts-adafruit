We paired a genuine JST connector with a slide switch that can do up to 600mA. Both are soldered onto a breadboard-friendly breakout. There's two ground pins, one 'switched' power pin, and one pin that is always on. This is compatible with the &quot;JST PH 2-pin&quot; connectors we use in our battery packs.. Mates perfectly with all our 1-cell LiPoly and LiIon batteries as well as our 6V coin cell holder and 3xAAA battery pack. We also have simple JST pigtails that mate with this connector.</p></body></html>","Author":"andydoro","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85422995","family":"Adafruit Switched JST Breakout","variant":"variant 1","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #1863","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Jul 29 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_60434882bf3dee889232fe51d23a77b2_1"},"Tags":[]}
