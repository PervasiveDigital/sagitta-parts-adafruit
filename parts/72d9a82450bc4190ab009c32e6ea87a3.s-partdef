It's affordable but sounds great! The NXP UDA1334A is a jack-of-all-I2S-trades: you can use 3.3V - 5V logic levels (a rarity), and can process multiple different formats by setting two pins to high or low. The DAC will process data immediately, and give you a clear, analog, stereo line level output. It's even cool with MCLK-less I2S interfaces such as the Raspberry Pi (which it's ideal for) - a built in PLL will generate the proper clock from the bitclock signal.</p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">For inputs, you can use classic I2S (the default) or 16-bit, 20-bit or 24-bit left justified data. You can set it up to take an input system/master clock but we default-set it to just generate it for you, so you only need to connect Data In, Word Select (Left/Right Clock) and Bit Clock lines. If you want, there's a mute pin and a de-emphasis filter you can turn on.</p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">We put in plenty of ferrite beads, a low-dropout regulator, and the recommended band-pass filter so you get a very nice clean output. With a sine-wave generator we swept through 20-20KHz and saw no attenuation or distortion. Plug into either the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack or the breadboard-friendly pads. We think you'll be pleased with this DAC!</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85436396","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit UDA1334 I2S DAC","part number":"Adafruit #3678","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Mon Nov 20 2017","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_8b114e360a67d82fe89bec7c7fcbc0ad_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_8b114e360a67d82fe89bec7c7fcbc0ad_1_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.5608341,"NativeHeightInInches":0.99999964,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_8b114e360a67d82fe89bec7c7fcbc0ad_1_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.7,"NativeHeightInInches":1.3,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_8b114e360a67d82fe89bec7c7fcbc0ad_1_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.5984869,"NativeHeightInInches":1.0001341,"Layers":{}}}}
