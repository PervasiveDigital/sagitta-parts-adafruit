So far we've carried the very nice MAX31855 which is an SPI interface thermocouple amplifier. The '855 is great but if you have a lot of thermocouples to measure it isn't terribly easy to use. That's why we are also carrying the new '850 model from Maxim - it's a &quot;1-Wire&quot; thermocouple amp which can have any number of breakouts on a single shared I/O line.</span></p>\n<p style=\"-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-family:'.Helvetica Neue DeskInterface'; font-size:13pt;\"><br /></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\"><span style=\" font-family:'.Helvetica Neue DeskInterface'; font-size:13pt;\">The MAX31850K does everything for you, and can be easily interfaced with any microcontroller that has 1-Wire support. This breakout board has the chip itself, a 3.3V regulator with 10uF bypass capacitors all assembled and tested. This board can be used with 'parasitic power' - where the power is on the data line - or with 'local power' where the power for the converter comes in on the Vin Pin.</span></p></body></html>","Author":"andydoro","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85428222","variant":"variant 2","family":"Adafruit MAX31850K","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #1727","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Thu Aug 18 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_746f693f824168135f11babfcc112fd4_1"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_746f693f824168135f11babfcc112fd4_1_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.8,"NativeHeightInInches":0.8,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_746f693f824168135f11babfcc112fd4_1_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.4,"NativeHeightInInches":1.2,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_746f693f824168135f11babfcc112fd4_1_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.8,"NativeHeightInInches":0.8,"Layers":{}}}}
