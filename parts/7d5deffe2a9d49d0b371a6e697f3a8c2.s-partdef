We have a couple digital thermocouple amplifiers in the shop already from Maxim. Now we're happy to introduce an excellent analog-output amplifier. This is a very simple sensor to use, and if your microcontroller has analog input capability, you'll be ready to go really fast!<br /><br />The AD8495 K-type thermocouple amplifier from Analog Devices is so easy to use, we documented the whole thing on the back of the tiny PCB. Power the board with 3-18VDC and measure the output voltage on the <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">OUT</span> pin. You can easily convert the voltage to temperature with the following equation: Temperature = (Vout - 1.25) / 0.005 V. So for example, if the voltage is 1.5VDC, the temperature is (1.5 - 1.25) / 0.005 = 50Â°C</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85419696","family":"Adafruit AD8495","variant":"variant 1","part number":"Adafruit #1778","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Mon Jul 4 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_bc02d886f56f1f4d7c20b99372dc478a_7"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_bc02d886f56f1f4d7c20b99372dc478a_7_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.65,"NativeHeightInInches":0.811732,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_bc02d886f56f1f4d7c20b99372dc478a_7_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.0,"NativeHeightInInches":0.9,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_bc02d886f56f1f4d7c20b99372dc478a_7_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.65,"NativeHeightInInches":0.811732,"Layers":{}}}}
