This sensor is great for all sorts of weather/environmental sensing and can even be used in both I2C and SPI! </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring humidity with ±3% accuracy, barometric pressure with ±1 hPa absolute accuraccy, and temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy. Because pressure changes with altitude, and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with  ±1 meter or better accuracy!</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85418802","part number":null,"family":"Adafruit BME280","variant":"1","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sat Jul 2 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_136a07ae8aaf30250653a8807cd44496_1"},"Tags":["barometric","pressure","bme280","adafruit","i2c","spi","temperature","sensor","humidity"]}
