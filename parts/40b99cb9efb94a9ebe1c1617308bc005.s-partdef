At its heart is a TPS61030 boost converter from TI. This boost converter chip has some really nice extras such as low battery detection, 4A internal switch, synchronous conversion, excellent efficiency, and 700KHz high-frequency operation.","Author":"Dean Cording","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85411099","family":"PowerBoost","output connector":"Pad","input connector":"Pad","variant":"1000","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"1","fritzingDate":"2014-08-17","fritzingModuleId":"PowerBoost 1000 Basic Pad Pad"},"Tags":["adafruit","tps61090","boost converter","breakout"]}
