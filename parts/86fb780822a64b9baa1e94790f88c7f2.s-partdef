Simply tell the chip which LED on the grid you want lit, and what brightness and it's all taken care of for you. </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">The IS31FL3731 is a nice little chip - it can use 2.7-5.5V power and logic so its flexible for use with any microcontroller. You can set the address so up to 4 matrices can share an I2C bus. Inside is enough RAM for 8 seperate frames of display memory so you can set up multiple frames of an animation and flip them to be displayed with a single command.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85425220","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit CharliePlex Driver IS31FL3731","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #2946","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Aug 2 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_a228b5ce0f63b6b1cd492c02270f18b4_13"},"Tags":[]}
