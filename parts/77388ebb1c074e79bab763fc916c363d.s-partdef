There's no firmware to deal with, so you don't have to deal with how to &quot;send data to and from an Arduino which is then sent to and from&quot; an electronic sensor or display or part.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85422583","family":"Adafruit FT232H Breakout","variant":"variant 1","part number":"Adafruit #2264","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Jul 19 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_4cd39c5b970a0036b732e9b336f0af59_13"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_4cd39c5b970a0036b732e9b336f0af59_15_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_4cd39c5b970a0036b732e9b336f0af59_15_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_4cd39c5b970a0036b732e9b336f0af59_15_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
