It has a wide usage range, from +-2g up to +-8g yet is easy to use with Arduino or another microcontroller </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">The MMA8451 is a miniature little accelerometer from Freescale, who are (by this point) masters at the accelerometer-design game. It's designed for use in phones, tablets, smart watches, and more, but works just as well in your Arduino project. Of the MMA8451/MMA8452/MMA8453 family, the MMA8451 is the most precise with a built in 14-bit ADC. The accelerometer also has built in tilt/orientation detection so it can tell you whether your project is being held in landscape or portrait mode, and whether it is tilted forward or back</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85425677","family":"Adafruit MMA8451 Accelerometer","variant":"variant 1","part number":"Adafruit #2019","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Thu Aug 4 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_26720a0b6638cf55809cbb19cc3c14cd_7"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_26720a0b6638cf55809cbb19cc3c14cd_9_breadboard.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.8,"NativeHeightInInches":0.7,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_26720a0b6638cf55809cbb19cc3c14cd_9_schematic.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.1,"NativeHeightInInches":1.0,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_26720a0b6638cf55809cbb19cc3c14cd_9_pcb.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":0.8,"NativeHeightInInches":0.7,"Layers":{}}}}
