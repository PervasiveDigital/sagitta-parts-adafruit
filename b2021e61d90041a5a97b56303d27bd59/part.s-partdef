Snap in your Spark and upload the NeoPixel library code to light up the LEDs, make an Internet of Blinky! Each LED is addressable as the driver chip is inside the LED. Each one has ~18mA constant current drive so the color will be very consistent even if the voltage varies, and no external choke resistors are required making the design slim. Power the whole thing with about 3.5-5.5 VDC battery pack and you're ready to rock. </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">To make your project portable, we have a JST connector for attaching an external battery. Power with 3.5 - 5.5V DC, a rechargeable LiPoly or LiIon cell battery works great, or 3xAAA or 3xAA battery pack. The JST included is so you can make your own battery connection. Use pin <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">D6</span> for the NeoPixel library code, all other pins are availale to use and have two breakouts on either side so you can wire up other sensors or devices.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85422585","family":"Adafruit NeoParticle Ring","layer":null,"variant":"variant 1","part number":"Adafruit #2268","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Jul 19 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_44bad853150761cf090dc5138dbf8eea_19"},"Tags":[]}
