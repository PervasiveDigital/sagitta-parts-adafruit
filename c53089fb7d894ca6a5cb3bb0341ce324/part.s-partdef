This slim little board has a class D amplifier onboard that can drive 2 channels of 4-8 ohm impedance speakers at 20W each. Power it with 5-12VDC using the onboard DC power jack and plug stereo line level into the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack and jam out with ease. Since it's class D, its completely cool-running, no heat sinks are required and it's extremely efficient - up to 93% efficiency makes it great for portable or battery powered rigs.<br /><br />We like the MAX9744 amplifier at the heart of this board because its very easy to use, but it also has <span style=\" font-style:italic;\">both analog and digital</span><span style=\" font-weight:600; font-style:italic;\"> </span>volume control capability. Use a single 1KÎ© pot (we include one) to adjust volume analog-style. Or hook it up to your favorite microcontroller and send I2C commands to set 64-steps of volume amplification.<br /></p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85423209","layer":null,"part number":"Adafruit #1752","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit MAX9744 20W Amplifier","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sat Jul 30 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_7c0865924db67f065d5c107527189af8_1"},"Tags":[]}
