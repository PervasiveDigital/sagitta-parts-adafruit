{"Id":"e0df2263-9ea7-4068-b5b1-5717a5057c5f","Title":"3.5in TFT 480x320 Touch + MicroSD","Description":"This TFT display is big (3.5\" diagonal), bright\n(6 white-LED backlight) and colorful! 480x320 pixels with individual RGB pixel control.\nThis display also has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect\nfinger presses anywhere on the screen.\n\nThere is a controller built into the display with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done\nby the microcontroller. The display can be used in two modes: 8-bit or SPI. For 8-bit mode,\nyou'll need 8 digital data lines and 4 or 5 digital control lines to read and write to the display\n(12 lines total). SPI mode requires only 5 pins total (SPI data in, data out, clock, select, and d/c)\nbut is slower than 8-bit mode. In addition, 4 pins are required for the touch screen (2 digital, 2 analog) or\nyou can use a resistive touchscreen controller to use I2C or SPI.\n\nOn the rear of the display is a microSD socket.\n","Author":"Dean Cording","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85411108","family":"TFT","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"1","fritzingDate":"2014-09-08","fritzingModuleId":"3.5in 480x320 rev B"},"Tags":["adafruit","tft","touchscreen","microSD","spi"]}
