The breakout uses a latching analog circuit that is triggered by a push of the button. Press once to turn on, then press again to turn off. The circuit uses a 3A P-FET to connect and disconnect the <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">IN</span> pin to the <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">OUT</span> pin. Works great from 3V to 14VDC and up to 3A (although the FET gets a little toasty at continuous 3A draw) yet has only 0.5uA quiescent current draw.<br /><br />Using it is easy: connect the power source to Ground and IN, then the load from Ground to OUT. We include a 12mm tactile switch that works well but you can solder in your own switch as well. Press the button (or short the button pins) to alternate between on or off. A on-board red LED will light up when active so you know its working. There's a fourth <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">KILL</span> pin, which you can use to turn off the load and/or keep it off even if the button is pressed. When 1 or more volts is applied it will instantly turn off the FET. This allows your project to turn itself off.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85431601","part number":"Adafruit #1400","family":"Adafruit Push Button Powerswitch","variant":"variant 1","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Aug 26 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_18cf85a26c5f49e25efbaf39eb5d92d8_1"},"Tags":[]}
