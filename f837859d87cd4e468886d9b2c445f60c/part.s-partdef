Or maybe you just need a small amount of prototyping space and a larger breadboard size is too big? Put down that PCB shear and pick up a Perma-Proto in the new exciting shape!<br /><br />Customers have asked us to carry basic perf-board, but we never liked the look of most basic perf: its always crummy quality, with pads that flake off and no labeling. Then we thought about how people <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">actually</span> prototype - usually starting with a solderless breadboard and then transferring the parts to a more permanent PCB. That's when we realized what people would really like is a proto board that makes it easy!<br /><br />This proto-board is the PCB you always wish you had, but never realized it! We took the basic layout of a half-sized breadboard, extended it to the size of a mint tin and turned that into a beautiful PCB. The top side has a white silkscreen, and the same markings you're familiar with, to make transferring components easy. The bottom has 15 rows of 5-hole pad design that matches a classic breadboard, with 2 power bus lines in the middle, and no mask so you can easily cut traces when necessary. There are another 48 holes for general wiring on the edges. We used 1.2mm diameter drill holes so even parts with big leads will fit. All holes are <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">thru-plated for strength</span> - these wont peel off with rework. The finish is a gold plate - <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">you won't get oxidation like with bare copper perf</span>! There are also four big mounting holes so you can attach the PCB to the tin. A perfect match for a Altoids &quot;Smalls&quot;-sized mint tin</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85432538","layer":null,"family":"Adafruit Perma Proto Small Mint","variant":"variant 1","part number":"Adafruit #1214","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sun Aug 28 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_7ce61c5b5fa144bd60f07bf31020eb42_2"},"Tags":[]}
