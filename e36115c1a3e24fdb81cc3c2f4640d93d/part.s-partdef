This chip can handle up to 12 individual touch pads.<br /><br />The MPR121 has support for only I2C, which can be implemented with nearly any microcontroller. You can select one of 4 addresses with the ADDR pin, for a total of 48 capacitive touch pads on one I2C 2-wire bus. Using this chip is a lot easier than doing the capacitive sensing with analog inputs: it handles all the filtering for you and can be configured for more/less sensitivity.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'AdaFruit.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85418804","variant":"1","part number":null,"layer":null,"family":"Adafruit MPR121","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sat Jul 2 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_9830be22bcf2598af562418b4258f4fb_1"},"Tags":["mpr121","i2c","capacitive","touch"]}
